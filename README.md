PowerBI Dashboard
Problem Statement:-
A bank in USA hired a Data Analytics team to analyse their loan applications that they are disbursing to different classes of peoples in various states.
Getting the data:-
Data for the loan applications was provided in a csv file conatining more than 10 columns and having 30k+ rows of data.

The data was already cleaned we dont have to clean it further.

Data Modelling:
We had to create one calender table for the date on which loan was issued and later we created a relatonshp between the fact table and the date table.

Measures:-
We have created measures for visualization purpose by using functions like calculate,sum,datestyd,filter,totalytd,avg,divide etc.

Data Visualiztion:-
We have created 3 page report:
1.Summary
2.Overview
3.Details

In this project we have used many visualizations like Cards,Pie Chart,Donut Chart,Line Chart,Bar Chart,Text Box Shapes,Page Navigation so that we can get a crisp and clear insights by looking at the chart itself.

Conclusions:-
1.Out of the total applications 86% are good loans(it means that either the customer has fully repaid the loan amount or they are aying their EMI's reguarly) but the bank has 13.82% bad loans(it means customer has not repaid the loan aount or they are not paying their EMI's time to time)
2.The loan applications is increasing by 6.91% every month.
3.Maximum loan aplications are for debt consildations followed by credit card.
